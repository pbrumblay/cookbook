Pour 1 inch boiling water into 13 by 9-inch baking dish and slip noodels into water, one at a time. Let noodles soak until pliable, about 5 minutes, separating noodles with tip of knife to prevent sticking. Remove noodles from water and place in single layer on clean dish towels; discard water and dry off baking dish.\n4. Spread half of meat sauce over bottom of baking dish. Spread 1/4 cup ricotta mixture evenly over bottom of each noodle. Roll noodles up around filling and lay them seam side down in baking dish. Spread remaining sauce over top to cover pasta completely. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil and bak until bubbling around edges, about 40 minutes. Remove foili and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup provolone.

    "Instructions": "Trim fat from beef.  Cut crosswise into 1/2 inch thick slices.  Cut each slice across grain into 1/2 inch wide strips.  Slowly heat large heavy skillet.  In it, melt 2 tablespoons butter.  Add just enough beef strips to cover the bottom.  Over high heat, sear quickly on all sides.  With tongs, remove beef as it browns.  (Should be browned outside, rare inside.)  Brown the rest of the beef.  Set aside.  Add remaining butter, saute mushrooms and onion until golden.   Remove from heat.  Add flour, garlic, Kitchen Bouquet, ketchup, salt and pepper.  Stir until smooth.  Gradually add broth and bring to a boil, stirring.  Reduce heat, simmer 5 minutes.  Over low heat, add wine and sour cream, stirring until well combined.  Add beef;  simmer until sauce and beef are hot.  Serve with cooked noodles.  \r\n\r\nNote:  I use Campbell's beef broth",

Do not try to remake more that 8 cups of jam or jelly at one time.  If Trial Batch sets satisfactorily, follow recipe above, using the listed measures of sugar, lemon juice and Certo Fruit Pectin for EACH 1 cup of jam or jelly.

Invert jars 5 minutes, then turn upright.  Or follow water bath method recommended by USDA.  After jars are cool, check seals.\r\n\r\nAfter preparing remainder of batch, discard Certo Fruit Pectin in opened pouch.\r\n\r\n7.

Scatter muffin cubes on top of Canadian bacon.  Top with remaining Canadian bacon, scattering it evenly over muffin cubes.  Pour egg mixture over casserole.  Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours, to let bread absorb egg mixture.\r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees.\r\n\r\nRemove casserole from refrigerator, and uncover it.  Lightly sprinkle paprika evenly over top.  Cover casserole with foil and bake 40 minutes.  \r\n\r\nRemove dish from oven, remove foil, return dish to oven and continue to bake, uncovered, until the eggs are set and the bacon on top begins to crisp, about 20 minutes more.  Remove casserole from oven and let stand 5 minutes before serving.\r\n\r\nTo serve, cut casserole into squares and place on individual plates.  Spoon warm Hollandaise sauce over each serving just before serving.  Makes 10 servings.\r\n\r\nEasy Hollandaise Sauce:\r\n\r\n1/2  Cup (1 stick) Butter\r\n4     Large Eggs\r\n1/2  Cup Whipping Cream\r\n2     Tablespoons Lemon Juice\r\n1     Teaspoon Dijon Mustard\r\n\r\nCut butter into 4 pieces and place in 1 quart glass measure or bowl and microwave, covered with paper towel, on high, until almost melted, 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Remove butter from microwave and stir until completely melted.\r\n\r\nSeparate eggs, placing yolks in small bowl and setting whites aside for another purpose.\r\n\r\nBeat yolks well with whisk or fork, then add to butter and stir well.  Add cream and lemon juice to egg mixture and stir well.  Microwave mixture, uncovered, on high, until just slightly thick, about 1 to 2 minutes, stopping every 20 seconds to stir with fork.\r\n\r\nRemove sauce from microwave and stir in mustard.  Makes about 1 1/2 cups.\r\n\r\nNote:  This sauce may be kept warm in a Thermos container up to 4 hours.  Or you can cool the sauce to room temperature and refrigerate it in a covered microwave-safe container for up to 24 hours.  To re-warm, cover the container with plastic wrap, pierce wrap with a knife to vent, and microwave on 50% power until heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to stir halfway through.  Do not allow sauce to boil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:  I haven't tried the above Hollandaise recipe.  I use the recipe under \"sauces.\"",

When it is melted, add the shallots and garlic and saute until aromatic but not browned, about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nRemove the skillet from the heat and add the brandy; be careful here, because the brandy may ignite.  Add the cream and mustard to the skillet and return the skillet to the heat, increasing the heat to high.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.  Return the chops to the skillet, along with any accumulated juices, and simmer until the sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon and the chops are just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn the chops in the sauce once as they cook.\r\n\r\nRemove the skillet from the heat and season the chops with the lemon juice and salt and pepper.  Transfer the chops to a serving platter, spoon sauce over them, and serve immediately, sprinkled with the chopped fresh herbs.\r\n\r\nNote:  You can substitute milk for the cream.

Place medallions with the cut side up and press down with the palm of your hand to flatten slightly. Season the meat with salt and pepper.\n2. Heat 3 T oil and 1 T butter in a large skillet over high heat, somewhere between medium-high and high. You want a really hot pan, but not so hot that it will scorch.  When the butter is melted and foaming, add the meat and sear until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Don't over-crowd the pan.  Do in two batches, if necessary. Flip and cook the other side until the meat is well browned and slightly firm to the touch, about another 2 minutes. Transfer the pork to a plate. 3. Melt the remaining 2 T butter in the pan.  Add the shallots and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring for about 30 seconds, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Add the mushrooms and cook until all of the mushroom liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are golden, about 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with the flour and add the Marsala.  Allow the Marsala to boil until almost completely evaporated.\n4.  Once the Marsala has almost completely evaporated, add the chicken broth and cook until the mixture is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the cream and parsley.  Return the pork and any accumulated juices to the pan, and cook, flipping the pork once, until it is firm to the touch and still a little pink in the middle, 2 to 4 minutes.  Taste for salt and pepper and serve.  Serve garnished with additional parsley.",

Go to a chinese restaurant to see what I'm talking about .\r\n\r\n1. Heat water almost to boiling in large bowl. This will be used to wet rice paper when making rolls.\r\n2. Put ground pork in big mixing bowl.\r\n3. Boil bean thread, strain, cut into manageable lengths, add to bowl.\r\n4. Soak black fungus in boiling water, strain, cut into manageable lengths, add to bowl.\r\n5. Chop onions and green onions (2/3 the way up), add to bowl.\r\n6. Add oyster sauce, pepper, sugar, salt, cornstarch mixture, eggs.\r\n7. Knead mixture in bowl until even.\r\n8. Wet the rice paper in the hot water (from step 1). Once it becomes pliable but not too sticky, fold 1/3 of paper down. This gives the roll a thicker area to spread the meat mixture on.\r\n9. Place meat mixture on folded rice paper, spread so that there is 1 inch of space on each of the ends. \r\n10. Fold the ends of the rice paper on top of the meat mixture.\r\n11. Roll it up, pulling the roll if necessary to make a firm wrap.\r\n12. Repeat steps 8 through 11 until all rice paper or meat mixture is gone.\r\n13. Poke rolls with toothpick liberally (this prevents them from blowing up in the fryer).\r\n14. Fry rolls in deep fryer at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until fryer is noticeably quieter (the water will have been cooked off � the water is what makes the fryer loud!).\r\n",

Roll up from long end and seal edges, folding under ends.  Place seam side down in greased loaf pan ( 9\" x 5\" ), butter tops, cover, and let rise until double - about 1 hour. \r\n\r\n Bake at 375 degrees for 40 minutes.  Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.\r\n\r\nNote:  If dough doesn't rise high enough before baking, start the loaves in a cold oven.  The fast warming oven will force-rise the dough.",
